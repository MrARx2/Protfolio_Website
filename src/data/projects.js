In striker rounds, you control a puck-like player aiming to score in the rival's goal while bouncing shots off speed-boosting bumpers that add unpredictability and challenge. In goalie rounds, you defend your goal along a vertical line—just like Pong—blocking fast, chaotic rebounds. One role is always controlled by AI, keeping matches dynamic. The game's neon-emissive visuals, colorful ball reactions, and punchy VFX/SFX create a vibrant, arcade-like atmosphere that keeps the action intense and unpredictable.",

With only two lives per run, failure means starting over—making every jump and interaction count. Designed for replayability, Fox's Tale captures the fun and simplicity of old-school platformers with modern polish and tight controls.",
